      "answer": "Climate change and rising sea levels have a bidirectional cause. As greenhouse gas emissions increase due to human activities, they contribute to global warming, leading to melting of polar ice caps and glaciers. This, in turn, causes sea levels to rise as more water is released into the oceans. Conversely, as sea levels rise, coastal areas become more vulnerable to flooding and erosion, which can exacerbate climate change by releasing more carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost and ocean acidification. The consequences of this bidirectional cause include increased risk of coastal flooding, saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, and loss of biodiversity.",

Similarly, as cities grow, they can also lead to environmental degradation, pollution, and strain on resources, which can discourage people from moving to the city, leading to a decline in population growth. Another example is the relationship between climate change and extreme weather events. As global temperatures rise due to climate change, we can expect more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and storms, which can lead to increased migration of people to coastal areas or higher elevations, straining local resources and infrastructure.",

While this suggests that watching TV may be associated with increased obesity, it does not mean that watching TV causes obesity. In fact, other factors like diet and exercise habits are likely to play a much larger role. Despite these limitations, correlation research can still provide valuable insights into relationships between variables and allow for the use of preexisting data, which can save time and money.
