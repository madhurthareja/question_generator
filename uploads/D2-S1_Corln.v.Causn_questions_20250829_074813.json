This is an example of a correlation-causation fallacy, where the researcher suspects that the reported relationship between morning classes and GPAs might be due to the presence of other factors (e.g., better attendance and engagement) rather than the morning class itself being the cause of the increased GPA. Option B correctly identifies one of these potential confounding variables, making it the correct answer.",
